## Needlecast Validators

Needlecast Validators run with the moniker **needlecast** on the Aptos mainnet, networks in the Cosmos Ecosystem and beyond.

We have years of experience running enterprise infrastructure at scale. In web3, things move _much faster_. We constantly re-evaluate our setup and procedures, engaging with other validators on the best way to operate. We've been live for over 2 years on highly adversarial mainnets, navigating upgrades, governance, vulnerabilities, forks, disaster recovery and cyberattacks.

We care not only about following best-practice, but also helping to define it as the validator community expands.

Our peak AuS was over $300M, sitting consistently at >$100M and we've been part of many networks from genesis. We also helped with the launch and operation of the Juno Network for its first 18 months.

Envoy Labs offer smart contract and blockchain consulting to the right projects. If you are a network or foundation that wants an experienced validator team and has a delegation to offer, then get in touch via the link below.

We're also very active on the [Juno Discord](https://discord.gg/wHdzjS5vXx). Say hey if you see `the-frey`.†
