## Needlecast Validators

Needlecast Validators run with the moniker **needlecast** on several networks in the Cosmos Ecosystem.

Our years of experience running enterprise infrastructure at scale mean we are perfectly placed to work within current best-practice and help define it as the validator community expands.

We currently validate the Juno and Stargaze mainnets, and have been part of the core development team for Juno since the early days of the project.

Our validator setups represent current best practice, with:

- Sentry nodes
- Overcapacity of memory and compute on a per-network basis
- Heavy leverage of cloud solutions to provide additional redundancy and rapid DR
- Frequent backups
- Pervasive 2FA mandatory for staff
- Staff personal security measures and vetting
