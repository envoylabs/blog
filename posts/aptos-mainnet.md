# Aptos Mainnet

Until now, we were not able to speak publicly about this, but with the launch of Aptos Mainnet we're stoked to share our involvement with the project.

After several rounds of testnets, we're pleased to announce that we were selected to run an Aptos Foundation node.

In the pre-launch competitive testnets, we placed 15th out of hundreds of Validator teams.

If you're looking for an infrastructure partner as an investor to run a staking pool, then please get in touch. The minimum stake is 1MM Aptos tokens (APT).

Even if we can't service your exact needs, we will be able to refer you on to an Aptos node operator that we trust and recommend.
