# Aptos Mainnet

Until now, we were not able to speak publicly about this, but with the launch of Aptos Mainnet we're stoked to share our involvement with the project.

After several rounds of testnets, we're pleased to announce that we are running an Aptos Foundation node. In the pre-launch competitive testnets, we placed in the top 10 out of hundreds of Validator teams.

If you're looking for an infrastructure partner as an investor to run a staking pool, then please get in touch. Even if we can't service your exact needs, we will be able to refer you on to an Aptos node operator that we trust and recommend.
