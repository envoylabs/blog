# (de)NS Alpha testing is complete

![deNS](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/envoylabs/blog/gh-pages/assets/denstestnet.png)

Thanks to a bunch of keen community members testing (de)NS and giving us bug reports, feature suggestions and general feedback, we're now ready to release an alpha to Mainnet - look out for that in the coming days.

It's still live on Uni [here](https://dens.vercel.app/ids/needlecast), and we're going to be rapidly pushing out and testing some new features on there in the coming weeks.

As always, we welcome any feedback on the `#name-service` channel on the [Juno Discord](https://discord.gg/wHdzjS5vXx). When things get a busier, we might move to a separate Discord, but for now that's the place.

Thanks to everybody that tested, and helped us improve the service by reporting bugs.
